# Roadmap

<!--
The template ships this page as a skeleton: a project cut from the template replaces
every `TODO:` line below once `AGENTS.md`'s "Product" describes what the project is.
Nothing checks this page for leftover markers; the `steering-the-roadmap` skill says who
changes it, when, and from what. Delete this comment when the page is first filled in.
-->

This page records the project's direction: the outcomes it is working toward now, the
ones that come next, and the ones only intended for later. It sits between two other
homes and repeats neither:

- `AGENTS.md`'s "Product" says what the project is, for whom, and its non-goals.
  Nothing here contradicts a non-goal; moving one is the owner's call, made
  in that section first.
- The issue tracker holds the units of work, their priority tiers, and their `blocked:`
  and `on hold` labels (`triaging-issues`). This page links issues by number and never
  copies their bodies.

It records direction and authorizes nothing. An issue is implemented because it is
filed, tiered, and picked, never because a line here names it. It is not an ADR either:
it takes no status and no number, and a decision a line depends on is recorded as an
ADR ([the index](README.md)) and linked from here. Merged pull requests and closed
issues record what has shipped; `git log` shows the local history.

The owner decides what the page says; an agent proposes a change to it in a pull
request, and the change lands only once the owner has approved it.

- **Last reviewed:** TODO: YYYY-MM-DD, the date this page was last checked against the
  open issues

## Now

The outcomes being worked on, one to three of them. Each has its issues filed.

- TODO: **[an outcome, as what a user can do]** — why it comes first, in one sentence.
  Issues: #N, #N. Done when: [what can be observed — a command's output, a `just`
  recipe that passes, a behavior a user sees — not a task that was finished].

## Next

The outcomes that follow once Now's are done. An issue may already exist for one, often
parked as `on hold`; none is required.

- TODO: **[an outcome]** — why it follows Now. Before it moves up: [an ADR to write, an
  outcome in Now to land, an open question for the owner]. Issues, if any: #N.

## Later

Direction the project intends to take but has not ordered. No issue is filed for a line
here, apart from a parked one that a line names.

- TODO: **[an outcome]** — what would bring it forward.
