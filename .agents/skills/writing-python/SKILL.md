# Writing Python

**Owns:** how one module, class, or function is written, in any layer of `src/my_app/`
and in `scripts/`, including two rules other skills point here for: one-line command
and route docstrings, and never shadowing a builtin. **Does not own:** which layer code
belongs in, and the shape of models, ports, services, and adapters
(`designing-core-logic`); the `AppError` hierarchy, how an entry point reports it, and
whether an error is logged (`designing-errors`); a route (`building-api-routes`); a
command (`designing-clis`); how a test is written (`writing-tests`); the contract a
repository script keeps — imports, `main()`, `ERR_*` reports (`writing-repo-scripts`).

## Gates first

Enforced by: `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.ruff.lint] select` list and `[tool.mypy]`
`strict = true` — read the finding they report rather than a copy of their rules here.
Two of them carry a policy on top:

- mypy's `ignore-without-code` error code makes a `# type: ignore` name its error code.
  The reason written beside it, like the reason on a `noqa` or a per-file ignore, is
  AGENTS.md's policy ("Security and human approval"); no tool checks it. `cli/serve.py`
  shows the shape:

  ```python
  import uvicorn  # noqa: PLC0415 - keeps `my-app todo` from importing uvicorn
  ```

- Ruff's bandit rules (`S`) stay on; a `noqa` for one argues that specific check.

## Imports a framework reads at run time stay real

With postponed annotations, a name used only in an annotation belongs under
`if TYPE_CHECKING:`, and ruff's `TC` rules move it there. Pydantic models, FastAPI
routes, and Typer commands read their annotations at run time, so the types they name
must stay real imports. `pyproject.toml`'s `[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-type-checking]`
lists those base classes and decorators so ruff leaves them alone; a new framework hook
that reads annotations is added to that list, never silenced with a `noqa`. A FastAPI
dependency function has no decorator for that list to name — `building-api-routes`
covers that case.

`api/schemas.py` has both kinds in one file: `datetime` is a real import because a
`BaseModel` field names it, while `Todo` appears only in a method signature.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Literal

from pydantic import BaseModel

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from my_app.core.models import Todo
```

## Choosing a type for a value

- **An internal value:** `@dataclass(frozen=True, slots=True)`. A change is a new value
  built with `dataclasses.replace`, never an in-place edit (`Todo`, `TodoDraft`,
  `composition.Container`).
- **Pydantic `BaseModel`:** only at a serialization boundary — the wire format in
  `api/schemas.py` and the environment in `settings.py`. Never in `core/`.
- **`Protocol`, not an ABC,** for an interface (`core/ports.py`); `@runtime_checkable`
  only when a test must `isinstance` against it.
- **`TypedDict`** for a dict whose keys are fixed, such as a JSON shape you do not own.
  No module needs one yet.
- **`enum.Enum`** for a closed set instead of loose string constants; `IntEnum` when the
  members are also numbers, as `cli.errors.ExitCode` is for `typer.Exit`. Inside a
  Pydantic model a `Literal` field does that job on the wire (`HealthResponse.status`).
- **`Any`** only with a comment saying why nothing narrower fits, as in
  `api/routers/todos.py`:
  ``# Any: FastAPI's own type for `responses=` values is dict[str, Any].``

## Names and constants

- A literal that carries meaning is an `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` module constant in the module
  that owns the meaning (`MAX_TITLE_LENGTH`, `DEFAULT_PORT`, `ENV_PREFIX`); another
  module imports it rather than repeating the value.
- A boolean is named `is_`, `has_`, `can_`, or `should_` (`Todo.is_completed`). A wire
  format may spell it differently; the schema owns that mapping.
- A private helper is `_name`, an internal module `_name.py`; `__name` only to avoid a
  clash in a subclass hierarchy.
- **Never shadow a builtin.** A command or route whose natural name is a builtin gets a
  descriptive function name and its public name separately: `@app.command("list")`
  over `def list_todos(...)`.

## Functions, modules, and docstrings

- A 300-line module or a 40-line function is a review trigger, not a rule: split only
  along a real responsibility boundary. One logical concern per module.
- Prefer three or fewer parameters; group related ones in a frozen dataclass. An
  optional collaborator goes keyword-only after `*`:
  `create_app(settings=None, *, container=None)`.
- A Google-style docstring says why, not what the signature says. "A factory rather
  than a module-level `app` so each test gets a fresh store" belongs there.
- **A Typer command's or a FastAPI route's docstring is one plain-text line,** because
  it is published as `--help` or OpenAPI text. Its reasoning goes in a comment or the
  module docstring.

## Idioms

- **EAFP** for lookups and I/O: try the operation and translate the specific exception,
  rather than checking first. `adapters/memory.py` does it for a missing key:

  ```python
  try:
      return self._todos[todo_id]
  except KeyError:
      raise TodoNotFoundError(todo_id) from None
  ```

  `from None` drops a cause that adds nothing; `from error` keeps one that does, as
  `cli/errors.py` does when it turns an `AppError` into `typer.Exit`.
- **A context manager for every resource.** When an object's own `with` does not
  release it, compose `contextlib.closing`: `SqliteTodoRepository._transaction` closes
  the connection that `sqlite3.Connection`'s context manager only commits. A reusable
  boundary is a `@contextmanager` function (`cli.errors.exit_on_domain_error`).
- **`match`/`case`** for dispatch on type or shape (`_status_for` in `api/app.py`).
- **The walrus operator** where it removes a repeated expression:
  `if (path := settings.sqlite_path) is not None:` in `composition.py`.
- **Comprehensions** over `map()` and `filter()`; `*args`/`**kwargs` only when a call
  genuinely forwards them.
- **Time is never read directly** in the core; it arrives through the injected `Clock`
  (`designing-core-logic`).

## Exceptions and logger calls

- Catch the most specific exception that can happen, and handle it meaningfully or
  re-raise it; never swallow one, and never use one for ordinary control flow. Return
  `None` only when the caller expects absence.
- No module under `src/my_app/` logs yet; uvicorn's own log is the only one. When one
  does, it uses a module-level `logging.getLogger(__name__)` and calls
  `logger.exception(...)` inside the `except` block, which keeps the traceback — never
  `logger.error(str(error))`. **BACKGROUND:** `designing-errors` decides which errors
  are logged at all.

## Security

- A path built from outside input is resolved with `Path.resolve()` and checked to stay
  under its allowed root before it is opened.
- SQL uses `?` parameters only, with the statement a module constant spelled out in
  full (`adapters/sqlite.py`'s `_SELECT_ONE` and siblings).
- A subprocess takes a fixed argv list, never `shell=True`; its `# noqa: S603` names why
  the argv is safe (`tests/cli/test_serve.py`).

## Performance

Do not optimize preemptively. Profile a measured hotspot first, and put the measurement
in the pull request description.
