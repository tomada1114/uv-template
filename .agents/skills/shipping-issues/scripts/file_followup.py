"""file_followup.py — File a follow-up issue found while shipping another one.

A shipping run turns up real defects that are not the issue being shipped:
a sibling of the bug just fixed, a latent gap the diff walked past, a scope
the implementation agent deliberately declined. Fixing them inline silently
widens the PR; dropping them loses them. This files them instead, so the
finding survives the run as a ranked backlog entry.

The tier label is resolved against what the repo *already uses*. A repo whose
convention is `p2` gets `p2`, not a second parallel `priority: P2` vocabulary
that would split its own backlog in two. This script never creates a label
definition: `.github/labels.yml` declares them and `just labels` creates
them. Every label the issue needs — the tier, each `--label`, `blocked: design`,
`blocked: dependency` — must already exist, or nothing is filed and the missing
names are reported (exit 4).

`--blocked-by` writes the edge where `triaging-issues` asks for it: a
`## Dependencies` section with one `Depends on: #N` line per blocker (and a
`Blocks: #N` line per `--blocks` number), plus the `blocked: dependency` label.
The ship contract repeats it for the next run's planner.

The target repo is resolved once and echoed on every line of output. This
script writes to GitHub from whatever directory it is invoked in, and a
sub-agent's cwd is not always the repo being shipped — an unqualified `gh`
would happily file the finding against an unrelated repo that merely happens
to be the working directory. Pass `--repo` when in any doubt.

Usage:
    file_followup.py --title T --body-file F --tier P2 [--label L ...]
                     [--area SLUG] [--touches PATHS] [--blocked-by N,N]
                     [--blocks N,N] [--needs-design] [--found-while N]
                     [--repo OWNER/NAME]
                     [--dry-run] [--json]

`--needs-design` marks the new issue design-not-settled (`blocked: design` or
this repo's existing equivalent) — use it only when the finding names an open
design question rather than a verified fix. See
references/filing-followups.md. `--tier` is still required even then, so the
issue ranks correctly the moment the design is decided.

Exit codes:
    0 = issue created (or --dry-run resolved cleanly)
    1 = usage/environment error
    2 = no write access to this repo — report the finding in the run summary
        instead, and do not retry
    3 = invalid argument (unknown tier, missing body file)
    4 = a label the issue needs is not defined in this repo — nothing was
        filed; next: check the spelling, then `just labels`, then re-run
        the same call once
