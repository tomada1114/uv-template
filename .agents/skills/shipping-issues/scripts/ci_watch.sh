# ci_watch.sh — Wait for a PR's checks to settle and report a compact verdict.
#
# Usage: ci_watch.sh <pr-number> [--timeout SECONDS] [--log-bytes N]
#
# Prints:
#   verdict: PASS | FAIL | TIMEOUT | NO_CHECKS | ERROR
#   check_source: checks | actions+statuses  (which API the verdict came from)
#   head_sha: <sha>   the PR head commit the verdict is about, when readable;
#                     land_pr.sh --head-sha pins the merge to it
#   mergeable / merge_state / review_decision
#   on FAIL: the failing check names plus the tail of each failing run's log
#   ERROR means the check results could not be read at all, the watch ended
#   while a check was still unsettled, or the PR head moved during the watch —
#   never a green. A STALE check (or a `stale` run conclusion) counts as
#   unsettled: its result is for an outdated state and says nothing either way.
#
# Two ways to read a PR's CI, because one of them needs a permission not every
# token can hold. GitHub's fine-grained PATs have no Checks permission at all —
# it is absent from the permission list and from the token-creation UI — so for
# such a token `gh pr checks` and `gh pr view --json statusCheckRollup` both
# fail with "Resource not accessible by personal access token". This script
# probes the check-runs API once and, when it is unreadable, falls back to what
# a fine-grained PAT can read: the Actions runs for the PR's head commit
# (Actions permission) plus that commit's statuses (Commit statuses
# permission). `check_source` always says which one answered.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = PASS, 1 = FAIL, 2 = TIMEOUT, 3 = NO_CHECKS,
#             4 = usage/lookup error or ERROR
