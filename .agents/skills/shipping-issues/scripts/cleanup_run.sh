# End-of-run cleanup for shipping-issues. The ONLY deletion entry point the
# skill uses — the main loop and sub-agents never call rm / git worktree
# remove / git branch -D ad hoc (raw rm trips the permission prompt and
# stalls runs).
#
# Deletes, strictly and only:
#   1. With --worktree-root <root>: linked worktrees under <root>/ (see the
#      worktree pass below). Gitignored files inside a worktree (.venv,
#      caches, ...) do NOT block removal and are LOST with it — anything worth
#      keeping must be copied to the main checkout before cleanup.
#   2. Local branches: harness-internal worktree-agent-* (a leftover
#      branch-naming convention from the Claude Code harness — unrelated to
#      this skill's own git worktree usage, added above), and branches whose
#      PR is MERGED (per gh) with no other open PR on the same ref, and whose
#      tip is the very commit that merged PR's head was (headRefOid) — a
#      branch name reused for new work, or one with commits added after the
#      merge, is kept and reported
#   3. With --remote: the same merged refs that actually exist on origin, read
#      via `git ls-remote --heads origin` rather than local remote-tracking
#      refs — a ref delete-on-merge already removed on origin can still
#      linger as a local remote-tracking ref between fetches, and reading
#      those would list a deletion that would not actually happen, especially
#      under --dry-run where the fetch --prune below is only echoed, never run
#      (never the default branch), each matched against the merged PR's head
#      by origin's tip, as reported by that same ls-remote
#
# With one or more --branch <name>: the worktree, local-branch, and optional
# remote passes consider ONLY the named branches — each still subject to
# every guard above (merged PR, no open PR on the ref, not the default
# branch, not checked out in the main checkout or a surviving worktree). The
# automatic worktree-agent-* local pass is skipped, so a named
# worktree-agent-* branch is deleted only if it independently clears the
# merged-PR guard. Without --branch, behavior is unchanged.
