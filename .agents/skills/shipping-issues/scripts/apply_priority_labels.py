"""apply_priority_labels.py — Write the `priority: P0..P3` labels this skill ranks by.

The tier label is the backlog's persisted priority. Once every open issue
carries one, `issue_digest.py` orders the backlog by reading labels, and no
model has to re-read issue prose to re-derive priority on the next run.

Two ways to write them, both cheap for the caller:

  --backfill        every open issue without a tier label gets one: the tier
                    its ship contract declares, or the digest's suggested
                    one. Pure heuristic, no model involved, one summary line out.
  --set N=P0 ...    explicit assignments, for the handful the research pass in
                    references/priority-rubric.md judged differently. Run by the
                    triage sub-agent that did the judging, not by the parent.

Applying a tier removes any other tier label the issue carries, including
legacy spellings like `critical` or `priority/high`, so an issue always ends
with exactly one.

This script applies labels and never creates a label definition: definitions
come from .github/labels.yml through `just labels`, the one place they are
declared. Every label a call would apply is checked before the first write; a
missing one stops the call with nothing written (exit 4).

Usage:
    apply_priority_labels.py --backfill [--quiet] [--dry-run] [--json]
    apply_priority_labels.py --set 12=P0 [--set 9=P2 ...] [--quiet] [--dry-run]
    apply_priority_labels.py --set-design 12 [--set-design 9 ...] [--dry-run]
    apply_priority_labels.py --clear-design 12 [--dry-run]
    apply_priority_labels.py --clear-dependency 12 [--clear-dependency 9 ...] [--dry-run]
    apply_priority_labels.py --check-labels

`--set-design`/`--clear-design` mark or clear the soft "design not settled"
block that excludes an issue from automatic selection — see
references/dependency-triage.md. The block has two forms, and issue_digest.py
honors either: the label (`blocked: design` or a recognized equivalent) and a
`design=open` field in the body's `<!-- ship: ... -->` contract.
`--set-design` writes only the label; `--clear-design` clears both, rewriting
`design=open` to `design=settled` and leaving the rest of the body as it was.
Independent of the tier machinery above; tier and design-readiness are
orthogonal.

`--clear-dependency` removes a dependency-block label (`blocked: dependency`
or a recognized equivalent) once issue_digest.py reports every dependency the
issue records as closed — see its `stale_dependency_labels` field and
references/dependency-triage.md. Readiness never reads this label; clearing it
only corrects what a human reading the backlog sees. It may be combined with
--set-design/--clear-design in one call, but not with --backfill/--set/
--check-labels.

`--check-labels` only reports whether the four tier labels exist.

Exit codes:
    0 = labels applied (possibly zero changes)
    1 = gh invocation failed
    2 = no write access to this repo — labels cannot be used here; rank from the
        digest's suggested tiers instead and do not retry
    3 = invalid argument (unknown tier, unparsable --set)
    4 = a label this call would apply is not defined in the repo — nothing was
        written; next: `just labels`, then re-run the same call once
