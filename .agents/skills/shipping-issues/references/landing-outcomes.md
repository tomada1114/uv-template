# Landing outcomes

What `land_pr.sh` can return and what each result requires. Read it when the merge step
returns anything other than a clean merge.

`land_pr.sh <pr> --issue <n>` prints a `result:` line and, with `--issue`, an `issue:`
line. The `--issue` flag makes it re-check the closing link before merging (without
`--fix`: repairing the body is step 5's job) and confirm the issue really closed after,
closing it explicitly with a back-reference comment if GitHub's auto-close did not fire.
It merges only a PR whose `mergeStateStatus` is `CLEAN`, pinned to one head commit
(`--head-sha`, or the head it reads just before that check; it prints `head_sha:`). With
`--dry-run` nothing is written: an already-merged PR whose issue is still open reports
`issue: WOULD_CLOSE` instead of closing it.

The script has no `--auto`: it never arms auto-merge, and passing the flag is a usage
error. Arming auto-merge hands the merge to GitHub after this run has stopped watching,
while the go-ahead this skill merges on is a `verdict: PASS` from `ci_watch.sh` and a
`CLEAN` merge state. A PR that waits on a human review is held and reported, not armed.

These eleven are every `result:` the script prints
(`grep -o 'result: [A-Z_]*' land_pr.sh`):

Pass `--no-link-check` only if the user asked for it, or for a PR that deliberately does not close its issue. |

## Bringing a pushed branch up to date

A PR branch has already been pushed, so it is brought up to date by merging the default
branch into it, never by a rebase: a rebased branch needs a force-push, which the
sign-off for this skill does not cover (`AGENTS.md` › "Security and human approval").

```bash
git -C <workdir> fetch origin <default_branch> --quiet
git -C <workdir> merge origin/<default_branch>
git -C <workdir> push
```

A conflict is `recovery.md`'s "A merge conflict". A repository whose rules require
linear history and refuse this merge is a stop condition: record
`--event blocked --field reason=linear-history` and ask the human.
