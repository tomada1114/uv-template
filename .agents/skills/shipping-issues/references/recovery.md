# Recovery

Read when something in the workflow does not go the way step 3–7 assume. None of this
belongs in the hot path: every case here is a branch the run takes occasionally, and
carrying it in SKILL.md costs the whole prompt on every run to save one file read on a
few of them.

## After a context compaction

A long run outlives its own context: the host compacts it, and what survives is a
summary that may have dropped which PR is open, which attempt CI repair is on, or what
is held for the final confirmation. **Re-read `<runstate>/run.md` before the next step
that writes** — after any compaction, and whenever unsure what this run already did. It
is append-only and written as each event happens ([run-record.md](run-record.md)), so it
is the run's own account of itself; then confirm against GitHub and `git` before acting,
never re-run a write the record already shows landed.

## A sub-agent returned without its report

**It has still done work.** A run can come back with nothing but "waiting on the
background verification" — it started a long command in the background and returned
while polling it. Its edits, and sometimes its commit, are on disk.

Never re-spawn it. Read, in that issue's own working directory:

```bash
git -C <workdir> status --short
git -C <workdir> log --oneline <base>..HEAD
git -C <workdir> rev-list --count origin/<branch>..HEAD   # unpushed commits
```

Then finish the last steps from this session: verify the diff, run the gate, commit and
push. This is the cheapest recovery in the run — re-spawning would redo work already
done or, worse, duplicate it. The delegation templates tell agents to verify in the
foreground for exactly this reason; this is what to do when one does it anyway.

## A sub-agent stopped before pushing

Same reading, same rule: don't retry blindly. Resume with a new run naming only what is
left, or record `--event blocked` if nothing landed at all.

## The implementation missed or widened the spec

Judge the result in this context, against the issue and the design decision: start from
`git -C <workdir> diff --stat <base>...HEAD` — `<workdir>` is the main checkout in
serial mode and that issue's worktree in parallel mode, and running it in the wrong
directory reports on the wrong branch — plus the sub-agent's own `CHANGED` /
`SCOPE-NOTES` / `UNRESOLVED`. Open the hunks only in the files the spec actually
touches, not the whole diff by default.

Missing part of the spec, or quietly widened: send a patch round naming only what is
left — continuing the same agent where the host allows, otherwise a new run on the same
tier as the first. Don't re-run the whole task. Up to **2** resume/patch runs on top of
the first; a third miss means the issue itself is underspecified, so record
`--event blocked` and report `NEEDS-CLARIFICATION` instead of spawning again.

## The PR review did not settle

`review_watch.py` printed something other than `CLEAN` or `FINDINGS`. None of these is
a pass, and none is answered with a local review, an `@codex review` comment, or a
close/reopen of the PR — each would be a second review the owner did not choose.

- `verdict: PENDING_TIMEOUT` → the watch ended before the review did. Run it again;
  `pr_age_seconds:` counts from the PR's opening, so slices need no running total. Past
  1800 s with the review still `Running` (or no Completed row), treat it as `ERROR`.
- `verdict: NO_REVIEW` → the bot left no trace within `--grace` of the PR opening: the
  repository has no Codex integration, or it is not reviewing. Leave the PR open and
  unmerged, record `--event blocked --field issue=<n> --field reason=no-review`, and put
  it in the step 10 report. A second `NO_REVIEW` in the same run is a
  [stop condition](../SKILL.md#stop-conditions): every later PR would wait the same 15
  minutes for nothing. Whether this repository merges without a PR review is the
  owner's decision.
- `verdict: ERROR` → read `detail:`. A failed or cancelled review, or a summary naming a
  commit that is not on the PR, holds the PR the same way
  (`--field reason=review-error`). A draft PR was opened wrong: Codex never reviews a
  draft, and marking it ready is a write this run does not make on its own — hold it and
  report. An unreadable GitHub read: re-run the watch once before holding.

A held PR is not a failed issue for the rest of the batch: in `all` mode, skip what
depends on it and continue, as for any `FAILED` issue.

## CI reports the previous commit

The checks API still serves the PREVIOUS commit's results for a minute or two after a
push, so a watch started too early returns that run's verdict — and a stale PASS is
worse than a stale FAIL. Wait for the PR's new head commit to actually appear among the
branch's CI runs before starting `ci_watch.sh`.

## CI fails

Fill [agent-ci-repair.md](agent-ci-repair.md) and run it — inline, or by `executor` for
attempts 1–2 and `architect` once the same failure has survived two attempts in a row
(the second attempt continues the first agent where the host allows) — its work
directory set to whichever checkout holds the branch: the main checkout in serial mode,
that issue's worktree in parallel mode. Up to **3 attempts**. `PUSHED: no` ends the
loop.

A test deleted, skipped, or weakened to pass, or a "flaky" re-run without a diagnosis,
is a **failed outcome**, not a green one.

## `NO_CHECKS`, `ERROR`, and other non-verdicts

- `NO_CHECKS` → run the project's own verification command locally (the plan's `verify=`
  line names it) and merge on a local green. No such command at all → ask first; this is
  one of the run's two narrow pauses.
- `verdict: TIMEOUT` → CI has not settled yet. Re-run `ci_watch.sh` until the watches
  add up to 1800 s in total
  ([pr-ci-merge.md#waiting-inside-the-command-timeout](pr-ci-merge.md#waiting-inside-the-command-timeout));
  past that, treat it as `ERROR`.
- `verdict: ERROR` → re-read the actual PR/CI state before treating it as a green. An
  error is not a pass. With `unsettled_checks:`, the watch ended while those checks were
  still running, or a check came back `STALE` (its result is for an outdated state): run
  the same watch once more. "head moved … during the watch" means a push landed
  mid-watch: watch again, for the new head.
- `land_pr.sh` has twelve possible results and two of them must never read as success:
  [landing-outcomes.md](landing-outcomes.md).

## Bringing the rest of a parallel batch up to date

After each merge, the batch's remaining branches are behind the default branch. Bring
each one up to date **in its own worktree, before its own PR** rather than after a CI
failure:

```bash
git -C <runstate>/worktrees/<m> fetch origin <default_branch> --quiet
git -C <runstate>/worktrees/<m> merge origin/<default_branch>
git -C <runstate>/worktrees/<m> push
```

**Merge, not rebase** — step 3 already pushed these branches, so a rebase would need a
force-push, and this run does not force-push. A repository that requires linear history
is a stop condition, not an exception: record
`--event blocked --field reason=linear-history` and ask the human.

## A merge conflict

A conflict between two branches of the same batch means the grouping call was wrong for
that pair — either the plan was `PARTIAL` and the proposal was taken at face value, or
two issues touched the same ground without declaring it. Resolve it in that worktree
only if the conflict is mechanical. Otherwise record
`--event blocked --field reason=merge-conflict`, report it, and move on.

Worth doing either way: add the missing `touches=` to both issues' ship contracts (or
note it in the report) so the next run's grouping is mechanical where this one had to
guess.

## A red baseline

A red baseline is **the repository's problem, not the issue's**, and finding it before
an implementation run costs one command instead of a wasted spawn. Read the exit code
and the log's tail, never the full output.

`worktree_setup.sh` reports and does not decide: it tears nothing down and draws no
verdict about the repo. Judging the four `baseline:` outcomes is the calling session's,
and this is the whole list:

| `baseline:`                                 | What it means                                                            | What to do                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PASS`                                      | Nothing to judge.                                                        | Provision the rest of the batch.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `FAIL` in the worktree, main checkout green | Usually not worktree-viable in this run — but not always.                | Read the log's tail first: an absolute path in a config, a service the tests expect running, a fixture that exists only in the main checkout all fail this way and are fixable. Not fixable → the fallback below. |
| `FAIL` in the main checkout too             | The repository is broken, and it is not this issue's problem.            | A step 8 finding. The run may still be shippable on top of it — decide, and say which in the report.                                                                                                              |
| `TIMEOUT`                                   | The verify command never finished, so **nothing was proved either way**. | Almost always the wrong command was confirmed at step 1 — a watcher, a dev server. Pick the right one and re-run the baseline. Never treat it as a red baseline.                                                  |

Before concluding the repository is broken, read the red baseline against what is
actually in the tree: an untracked build or package-manager cache in the repo root can
fail the baseline on its own — for example a cache directory holding a unix socket,
which a test helper that copies untracked files hits with a bare `ENOTSUP`. This is why
the dirty-tree question is asked at plan time, before the baseline, rather than after
it.

Once "not worktree-viable" is concluded, remove that worktree
(`git worktree remove --force <path> && git worktree prune`) and record the verdict so
later runs skip the probe:

```bash
.agents/skills/shipping-issues/scripts/preflight.sh --profile-cache <runstate>/repo-profile.json \
    --set-worktree-viable no
```

Then fall back to serial and say so in the step 10 report. Record `yes` the same way
after a batch provisions cleanly — that is what lets the next run's plan skip the gate
entirely.

## A worktree that will not go away

`cleanup_run.sh` runs the worktree pass first because a branch checked out in a worktree
cannot be deleted. **Anything gitignored inside a worktree is lost with it** — a fixture
or benchmark output an implementation run produced and did not commit has to be copied
into the main checkout before cleanup, which is why the implementation template tells
sub-agents to do exactly that.
