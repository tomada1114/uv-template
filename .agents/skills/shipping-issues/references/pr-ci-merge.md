# PR, review, CI and merge (steps 4–7)

The detail behind [SKILL.md steps 4–7](../SKILL.md#4-open-the-pr): from an implemented,
pushed branch to a reviewed and merged PR, a closed issue, and a checkout back on the
default branch. This stretch is serial in both modes: one PR at a time, in the batch's
dependency-then-priority order — finish an issue's PR → review → CI → merge before
opening the next.

## Opening the PR

Commits but nothing pushed → push from this session
(`git -C <workdir> push -u origin <branch>`). No commits at all → no branch: record
`--event blocked --field issue=<n>`, report `SKIPPED(<why>)`, and in `all` mode move on.

Open a regular PR — never a draft, which gets no automatic review — from `<branch>`
against `<default_branch>`, titled `<PR-TITLE>`. A merge commit from bringing the branch
up to date (`git merge origin/<default_branch>`) before opening is fine: the review reads
the PR's head as it is when the PR opens. The body must
carry **`Closes #N`** after the summary (a bare `#N` closes nothing) and target the
**default branch** (auto-close only fires there) — build it from `PR-SUMMARY`,
`Closes #N`, `TEST-PLAN`. Record
(`--event pr-created --field issue=<n> --field pr=<url>`), then:

```bash
.agents/skills/shipping-issues/scripts/link_check.sh <pr> --issue <n> --fix
```

Run it before step 6's watch starts (a body edit starts no review): every body edit it makes fires the PR's `edited`
event, which re-runs the PR-title and labeling workflows, and a run cancelled by the
next edit must not land inside a watch. `land_pr.sh` re-checks the link at merge time
without `--fix`; this earlier call is not redundant, because it is the only one that
repairs, and it catches `WRONG_BASE` before CI spends thirty minutes on the wrong base.
`WRONG_BASE` → retarget before merging. When GitHub lists no link to the issue, `--fix`
reads the body first and never adds a second keyword:

- **No closing keyword for `#N` in the body** → it appends `Closes #N`.
- **The keyword is there, or was just appended, and GitHub still lists no link** → it
  re-saves the body: a minimal body of only `Closes #N`, then the full body put back, at
  most 2 times (4 edits), a few seconds apart, stopping as soon as the link appears. The
  full body is restored after every minimal save, including on an interrupt; if it
  cannot be, the verdict is `ERROR` and the detail names the file holding the full body
  and the `gh pr edit` that puts it back (the PR description's edit history on GitHub
  keeps it too) — restore it before anything else. A body it could not read is never
  rewritten (`ERROR`).

`NOT_LINKED`'s `detail:` says which case is left. "has no Closes/Fixes/Resolves
keyword", or "closes #M but not the target issue #N", means the body still lacks the
keyword (its `fix:` line says the edit failed): re-run `--fix`, or add `Closes #N` to
the body by hand. "has a closing keyword for #N, but GitHub has not linked it" means the
re-saves left the link missing: go on to steps 5 and 6 anyway. Step 7's `land_pr.sh` then
refuses the merge with `result: NOT_LINKED`, and the PR is held for the human
([landing-outcomes.md](landing-outcomes.md)): merging it with `--no-link-check` is their
decision, never this run's.

## Waiting for the PR review

The PR's review is the Codex GitHub integration's, posted by
`chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`. It runs when the PR opens (or a draft is marked ready, or
someone comments `@codex review`), and **a push may start another**: PRs #184 and #190
ended on a review of a fix-push head (observed 2026-10-08). This run never asks for one:
no `@codex review` comment, no close/reopen, no change to review settings. Each review
is a **round**, and at most 3 are handled per PR:

| Round                     | Fixed in this PR                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1, the opening review     | every accepted finding, whatever its badge                                                                                                              |
| 2 and 3, after fix pushes | an accepted `P0`, `P1`, `P2` or unbadged `P?`; an accepted `P3` goes to [step 8](../SKILL.md#8-close-out-the-findings-the-run-turned-up) as a follow-up |
| 4 or later, past the cap  | nothing: only `P0`, `P1` and `P?` are triaged, and an accepted one holds the PR for step 10; the rest are named at step 10, untriaged                   |

[Triage](implement-and-review.md#triaging-the-reviews-findings) is the same in every
round, judged against the code: the badge decides only whether an accepted finding is
fixed now or followed up. Fixes after round 3 get no further review — local verification
and current-head CI cover them, and the step 10 report says so.

What it looked like on PRs #170 and #171, both opened by a run of this skill (observed
2026-10-07): the summary comment appeared about 15 s after the PR opened with a
`🔄 **Running**` row naming the 7-character head commit and the trigger `PR opened`,
and was edited in place to `✅ **Completed**` about 2.5 minutes later. CI took about 3
minutes, so the two finish close together — and on #170 the merge on CI's `PASS` landed
at 19:26:55Z, 24 s **before** the review completed at 19:27:19Z. That race is why the
merge waits for both. A fix push may or may not start one (trigger `New commits`,
observed 2026-10-08): on #190 it started 12 s after the push and completed 4 minutes
later; on #184 one push started none, and the next started one 2 min 13 s after the
push — 9 s before the PR merged on CI alone, which is what the start grace prevents.

```bash
mkdir -p <runstate>/review
.agents/skills/shipping-issues/scripts/review_watch.py <pr> [--after-push <sha>] --timeout <seconds> > <runstate>/review/<pr>.log
grep -E '^(verdict|round|rounds|cap_reached|trigger|review_status|reviewed_sha|head_sha|reviewed_is_head|completed_at|later_review|pr_age_seconds|push_age_seconds|findings|round_findings|findings_file|detail):|^  - F' <runstate>/review/<pr>.log
```

Start it right after `link_check.sh`, alongside the CI watch: on a host that reports
background completion, both go in the background (`review_watch.py` with its default
`--timeout 900`), and neither blocks the other — both only read. Otherwise run them in
foreground slices, one after the other, under the host's command timeout
([waiting](#waiting-inside-the-command-timeout)); `NO_REVIEW` is measured from the PR's
opening, so review slices need no running total. **Merge only when both are terminal.**
Bodies of findings go to `findings_file:` and stay out of this context until triage;
each `F<n>` line carries its `round=`, and `round_findings:` counts the round just read.

**After each fix push** (rounds 1 and 2), run `review_watch.py <pr> --after-push <sha>`,
`<sha>` the commit just pushed, alongside the new CI watch. It waits a start grace
(`--start-grace`, 300 s, counted from its first call for that `<sha>`) for a review that
is not a settled round to start — when one comes it has started within about 2.5
minutes of the push (above).
One that starts is waited for by the same completion rules and reported as the next
round. `NO_NEW_REVIEW` means none started (or the one that did failed): the latest
settled round stands, and the PR lands on current-head CI `PASS`. CI takes about 3
minutes, so the grace costs at most about 2 minutes more. With `cap_reached: yes` it returns at once.

What counts as done is the trusted bot's own record: a summary comment by exactly that
login, `Completed`, naming a commit of this PR. `CLEAN` is that plus no review and no
inline comment from the bot for that round; its 👍 on the PR (`thumbs_up:`) corroborates,
and neither its presence nor its absence decides anything. Silence, green CI, a display
name, or a reaction alone is never completion. When `reviewed_is_head: no`, a push came
after the latest settled round: that round stands until a review of the new head
settles, and `--after-push` says whether one is coming.

Right before the merge, re-run `review_watch.py <pr> --after-push <head_sha> --timeout 0`
into the same log, `<head_sha>` the CI `PASS`'s: it is the file `land_pr.sh --review-log`
reads, and it lists any finding posted since the last read (numbers stay stable: a new
one is appended). A head no settled round has read gets its start grace here too — a CI
repair or a merge of the default branch is a push like any other — so a
`PENDING_TIMEOUT` there means re-run it with a `--timeout`, never merge. An untriaged finding is triaged before the merge by
its round's row above, even one from a review that settled after the grace — do not
wait for a review that started late, but do not ignore a defect it already named. The
summary keeps a single row, rewritten for the latest review (a `Manual request` row
replaced the opening one on PRs #154 and #156, observed 2026-10-07), so the watch
remembers every round it saw complete, and the current push's grace, in
`<runstate>/review/<pr>-rounds.json`, reporting a review not yet settled on
`later_review:`. Leave that file in place until the PR merges.

## Watching CI

Wait for the PR's new head commit to appear among the branch's CI runs before watching —
the checks API serves the previous commit's results for a minute or two after a push,
and a stale PASS is worse than a stale FAIL. Then:

```bash
.agents/skills/shipping-issues/scripts/ci_watch.sh <pr> --timeout <seconds> > <runstate>/ci/<pr>.log
grep -E '^(verdict|waited_seconds|head_sha|mergeable|merge_state|review_decision):' <runstate>/ci/<pr>.log
```

Redirected — raw output carries failing-run log tails that must stay out of this
context. Keep `failed_checks:` for repair. `ci_watch.sh` is the run's only wait
primitive: **never a hand-rolled sleep/poll loop**. One PR at a time, even in `all`
mode. Record (`--event ci ...`).

| `verdict:`           | Next                                                                                                                                      |

## Waiting inside the command timeout

CI can take up to 30 minutes to settle, and a host cuts a foreground command off well
before that. Pick the first of these the host supports:

1. **Foreground, in slices.** Run `ci_watch.sh <pr> --timeout <N>` with `N` safely below
   the command timeout this host applies to the call — raise the call's own timeout
   where the host lets it, and keep `N` under it. On `verdict: TIMEOUT`, add its
   `waited_seconds:` to a running total and run the same watch again; stop at 1800 s in
   total and treat the PR as `ERROR`. Each slice re-reads the PR from scratch, so
   nothing is lost between them.
2. **Background, with completion reported.** On a host that can run a command in the
   background and re-invoke the session when it exits, start
   `ci_watch.sh <pr> --timeout 1800 > <runstate>/ci/<pr>.log` that way and wait for that
   report. Until that verdict is read, nothing else on the shipping path moves — no next
   step 3, no other PR, no checkout or branch switch; the only work allowed meanwhile is
   draining [step 8b](../SKILL.md#8b-unblock-held-designs-in-the-background)'s
   background queue. A `TIMEOUT` after the full 1800 s is `ERROR`.

`review_watch.py` waits the same two ways, alongside `ci_watch.sh`: its default
`--timeout 900` is the single background call, and in slices each one re-reads the PR
(an `--after-push` grace counts from the first slice for that commit).
Never stand in for either with `sleep` or a poll loop of your own: the scripts' own
timeouts and verdicts are what make a stalled CI or a missing review a reported outcome
rather than a hung run.

## Merging

```bash
.agents/skills/shipping-issues/scripts/land_pr.sh <pr> --issue <n> --head-sha <head_sha> \
    --review-log <runstate>/review/<pr>.log
```

`<head_sha>` is the `head_sha:` line of the `PASS` in `<runstate>/ci/<pr>.log` — the
commit CI verified. The merge is pinned to it (`gh pr merge --match-head-commit`), so a
push that landed after the watch makes GitHub refuse the merge instead of merging an
unverified commit (`MERGE_REFUSED`: watch CI again). When the log has no `head_sha:`
line, omit the flag: the script then pins to the head it reads just before it checks the
merge state.

`--review-log` makes the script refuse the merge (`REVIEW_UNSETTLED`) unless the log is
this PR's and says `CLEAN` or `FINDINGS`, or `NO_NEW_REVIEW` after a push of the commit
being merged. It cannot tell whether findings were addressed — that is the triage above —
only that the review exists.

Merge as soon as CI reports `verdict: PASS` for the current head and the review has
settled — `CLEAN`, `FINDINGS` triaged with every fix its round calls for pushed and
covered by that `PASS`, or `NO_NEW_REVIEW` for that head — and call `land_pr.sh` in that
same turn. Do not ask whether to merge, and
do not report the green CI and wait: green CI on a reviewed PR is the approval. Read
`result:` and `issue:`. Every result, and the two that must never read as success:
[landing-outcomes.md](landing-outcomes.md). Record (`--event merged ...`). A review whose
`completed_at:` is later than the merge — a merge made without the guard, or by someone
else — is a step 10 line, so it can be checked.

## After the merge

```bash
git switch <default_branch> && git pull --ff-only
```

after every merge, and again as the run's last act — the run never ends parked on a
feature branch. In parallel mode the main checkout is already there; pull it anyway so
it carries the merge that just landed.

**Serial `all`:** re-plan (`plan.py --mode all --refresh --allow-existing-worktrees`)
and start the next issue's step 3 from this up-to-date branch, without pausing.
**Parallel `all`:** the batch's remaining branches are now behind; bring each up to date
in its own worktree **before its own PR** rather than after a CI failure, and merge
rather than rebase
([how](recovery.md#bringing-the-rest-of-a-parallel-batch-up-to-date)). A conflict either
way means the grouping call was wrong for that pair
([recovery.md#a-merge-conflict](recovery.md#a-merge-conflict)). Only when the whole
batch has merged does the run group the next batch.
