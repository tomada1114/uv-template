"""hook_payload.py — one payload shape for hooks that run on either host.

Copy this file into `<project root>/.agents/hooks/` next to the hook scripts
that import it, then:

    from hook_payload import load_event, project_root

    event = load_event()
    if event.name is None:
        raise SystemExit(0)          # unreadable payload: never block on it

It normalises the two dialects a hook payload arrives in. One host sends
`tool_input.file_path` for an edit; the other sends `tool_name: "apply_patch"`
with the patch text in `tool_input.command`. Both end up in `event.files` as
absolute paths.

Detect the host from the payload, never from environment variables: a project
variable that looks host-specific can be inherited from whatever process
started the session.

Standard library only, Python >= 3.10. Imported, never executed.
