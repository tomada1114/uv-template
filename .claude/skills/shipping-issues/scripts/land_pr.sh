# land_pr.sh — Merge a green PR using the repo's preferred method, then verify
# that the issue it was supposed to close actually closed.
#
# Usage: land_pr.sh <pr-number> [--issue N] [--method squash|merge|rebase]
#                   [--head-sha SHA] [--dry-run] [--no-link-check] [--no-ready]
#
# Without --method the script picks the first method the repository allows,
# preferring squash. It always merges now: it never arms GitHub auto-merge, so
# `--auto` is an unknown argument.
#
# With --issue N the script does the issue-closing bookkeeping the whole skill
# exists for:
#   * before merging, it runs link_check.sh (without --fix: repairing the body
#     is the PR step's job, and a re-save fires the PR's `edited` workflows), so
#     a PR whose issue is not linked is refused instead of merging and
#     orphaning the issue; link_check's ERROR is reported as `result: ERROR`;
#   * after merging, it confirms the issue really is CLOSED, and closes it with
#     a back-reference comment if GitHub did not (squash merges into a
#     non-default base, keyword lost in a body edit, …).
#
# A draft PR cannot be merged at all — GitHub refuses with "Pull Request is
# still a draft" — so by default the script marks it ready for review (`gh pr
# ready`) right before merging. Pass --no-ready to report `result: DRAFT`
# instead of ready-ing it (the caller decides when a PR should stay draft).
#
# It merges only a PR whose mergeStateStatus is CLEAN, and reports
# `result: NOT_CLEAN` with a `merge_state:` line otherwise (BLOCKED, BEHIND,
# DIRTY, UNSTABLE, …): a ruleset on the default branch is the only other
# guard, and a repository cut from this template has none until its owner
# adds one.
#
# The merge is pinned to one commit (`gh pr merge --match-head-commit`), so a
# push that lands after CI was read cannot be merged unverified: GitHub refuses
# it and the result is MERGE_REFUSED. Pass --head-sha with the `head_sha:` line
# ci_watch.sh printed for its PASS; without it the script pins to the head it
# reads just before it checks the merge state.
#
# With --dry-run nothing is written: on an already-merged PR whose issue is
# still open it reports `issue: WOULD_CLOSE` instead of closing the issue.
#
# Exit codes: 0 = merged, 1 = merge refused, 2 = usage
