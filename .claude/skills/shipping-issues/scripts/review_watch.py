"""review_watch.py — Wait for a PR's Codex reviews and report the latest one.

The pull request's review is the Codex GitHub integration's, posted by the
bot account `chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]`. About 15 s after a PR opens, the bot
posts one issue comment carrying the marker
`<!-- codex-pull-request-review-summary -->` and edits it in place: its table
row holds the review's status (`🔄 **Running**`, then `✅ **Completed**`, each
with a `<relative-time datetime=...>`), the 7-character short commit it
reviewed, and its trigger ("PR opened"). Running to Completed took about
2.5 minutes on PRs #170 and #171 (observed 2026-10-07). Findings arrive as a
COMMENTED review from the bot (`commit_id` = the reviewed commit) with inline
comments, each starting with a priority badge (`![P1 Badge]`, P0, P2, ...) and
a bold title. A clean review leaves no review and no inline comment; the bot
reacts 👍 on the PR, which this script reports as corroboration only.

Codex may review the PR again after a push: PRs #184 and #190 ended on a row
naming a fix-push head (observed 2026-10-08). The summary keeps one row,
rewritten for the latest review (a `Manual request` row replaced the opening
one on PRs #154 and #156), so each review is a round: every completed row
this script sees is remembered in <runstate>/review/<pr>-rounds.json (an older
<pr>-opening.json is still read), and every COMMENTED bot review, posted only
once its review completes, is a round too. Rounds are numbered in the order
they completed and identified by the commit they reviewed, never by trigger
text. Finding numbers follow the reviews' order, so a new round's findings are
appended and earlier numbers never move.

With --after-push SHA, the head just pushed, the call waits --start-grace
seconds, counted from the first call for that SHA, for a review that is not
one of the rounds settled before it to start. One that starts is waited for
and reported as the next round; none starting is NO_NEW_REVIEW, and the latest
settled review stands. Once 3 rounds had settled before the push
(`cap_reached: yes`), it waits for nothing and reports the latest round.

This script only reads. It never asks for a review: no `@codex review`
comment, no close/reopen, no reply to or resolution of a thread.

Usage:
    review_watch.py <pr-number> [--after-push SHA] [--start-grace SECONDS]
                    [--timeout SECONDS] [--grace SECONDS] [--bot LOGIN]
                    [--interval SECONDS] [--findings-file PATH]

  --after-push   the commit just pushed to the PR (7-40 hex). Without it the
             call reports the latest settled round, waiting only while none
             has settled yet (the opening review).
  --start-grace  how long after the first --after-push call for that SHA no
             new review starting means none is coming (default 300).
  --timeout  how long this call waits, in bounded polls (default 900). Run it
             in the background where the host reports completion, or in
             foreground slices under the host's command timeout; each slice
             re-reads the PR from scratch.
  --grace    how long after the PR opened silence from the bot means it is
             not coming (default 900): NO_REVIEW. Measured from the PR's own
             creation time, so slices add up without the caller counting.
  --bot      the trusted reviewer login (default chatgpt-codex-connector[bot]).
             Only a comment, review or reaction by exactly this login counts
             (a login without `[bot]` must also have account type Bot); a
             display name, or a person quoting the marker, never does.
  --interval seconds between polls (default 30).
  --findings-file  where finding bodies are written (default
             <runstate>/review/<pr>-findings.md, outside any checkout).

Prints:
  verdict: CLEAN | FINDINGS | NO_NEW_REVIEW | PENDING_TIMEOUT | NO_REVIEW | ERROR
  pr: <number>
  bot: <login>
  after_push: <SHA> | none
  round: <k> | none   (the round the next six lines describe: the latest
                    settled one, or none while no review has settled)
  rounds: <n>         (reviews settled so far)
  cap_reached: yes | no   (yes once 3 rounds settled: wait for no further one)
  review_status: <the round's status, e.g. Completed> | none
  trigger: <its review trigger> | none
  reviewed_sha: <the commit it read> | none
  head_sha: <the PR's head now> | none
  reviewed_is_head: yes | no   (no after a push no settled review has read)
  completed_at: <its completion time> | none   (compare it with the merge
                    time: a review that completed after the merge is a step
                    10 line)
  thumbs_up: yes | no
  later_review: <status> (<trigger>) for <sha> | none   (a review the summary
                    shows that is not a settled round: running, or failed)
  pr_age_seconds / push_age_seconds (since the first call for --after-push) /
  waited_seconds
  findings: <n> (every round's), round_findings: <n> (this round's), then one
  line per finding:
    - F<n> [P<k>] <path>:<line> id=<comment id> round=<r> — <title>
  findings_file: <path>   (when findings > 0; bodies stay out of this output)
  detail: <why>           (whenever there is one to give)

  CLEAN     the latest round's summary says Completed for a commit of this
            PR and that review left no finding (`thumbs_up:` corroborates;
            neither its presence nor its absence decides the verdict).
  FINDINGS  the latest round left findings; triage every one of that round.
  NO_NEW_REVIEW  --after-push only: no review started on the push within
            --start-grace, or the one that started failed. The latest settled
            round stands, and the PR can land on current-head CI.
  PENDING_TIMEOUT  this call's wait ended first: not posted yet, or still
            running. Run it again; `pr_age_seconds` (opening review) or
            `push_age_seconds` (a review after a push) says how long it waited.
  NO_REVIEW no trace of the bot `--grace` seconds after the PR opened.
  ERROR     the opening review failed or was cancelled, a summary names a
            commit that is not on this PR, the PR is a draft (never
            reviewed), or GitHub could not be read. Never a pass.

Exit codes: 0 = CLEAN, 1 = FINDINGS, 2 = PENDING_TIMEOUT, 3 = NO_REVIEW,
            4 = usage/lookup error or ERROR, 5 = NO_NEW_REVIEW
