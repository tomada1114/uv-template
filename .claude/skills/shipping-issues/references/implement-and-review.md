# Implement, then fix the PR review's findings (steps 3 and 5)

The detail behind [SKILL.md step 3](../SKILL.md#3-implement) — from a branch cut off the
default branch to an implemented, judged, pushed branch with no PR yet — and the fix half
of [step 5](../SKILL.md#5-wait-for-the-pr-review), where the PR's own review comes back
and its accepted findings are fixed on that same branch. No local review pass runs in
between: the review is the pull request's. Read it before the first step 3 of a run.

## Setting up the branch

One issue = one branch = one PR. Step 1's `next:` line is the command.

**Serial** —
`git switch <default_branch> && git pull --ff-only && git switch -c <branch>`, then run
the confirmed verification command **once, unmodified, on this branch**, redirected to
`<runstate>/verify/<n>-baseline.log`.

**Parallel** — the script creates each branch, copies untracked local config, installs
dependencies, and runs the baseline (bounded). It **reports and does not decide**:

```bash
git switch <default_branch> && git pull --ff-only   # once, before the batch
.agents/skills/shipping-issues/scripts/worktree_setup.sh --spec <n>:<branch> \
    --spec <m>:<branch> --base <default_branch> --root <runstate>/worktrees \
    --log-dir <runstate>/verify --verify "<confirmed verify command>"
```

**Provision the first worktree on its own, read its block, then ask for the rest** —
that one extra call is what stops a repo that cannot carry a worktree from costing three
dependency installs instead of one. Judging the four `baseline:` outcomes is yours, not
the script's ([all four](recovery.md#a-red-baseline); `verdict:` semantics
[here](worktree-parallelism.md#viability-gate)). Read exit codes and log tails, never
full output; what the smoke run turns up goes to step 8.

## Handing off the implementation

Fill [agent-implementation.md](agent-implementation.md) per issue
([delegation-templates.md](delegation-templates.md) holds the rules every brief shares).
Where the host has named sub-agents, hand it to **`executor`** by default and to
**`architect`** when the issue is foundational — blast radius, not difficulty
([the foundation exception](cost-discipline.md#the-foundation-exception-architect-for-what-the-backlog-builds-on)).
A change small enough that the handoff costs more than the work is implemented here
rather than handed off
([the floor](cost-discipline.md#the-floor-too-small-to-delegate)). With no tiers — a
host without named sub-agents, or a Codex CLI checkout whose `.codex/` layer is not
loaded because the project is untrusted — follow the brief inline, one issue at a time,
and run the batch **serial**: plan with `--max-parallel 1` and create no worktrees. Each
worktree costs a dependency install and a baseline, and with one writer working through
them in turn it buys no concurrency.

In parallel mode hand off every brief in the batch **before waiting on any** — in one
message where the host batches spawns — each with its own worktree path, never the main
checkout.

## Judging the result

**Judge each result in this context**, against the issue and step 2b's decision. What
each returned field is for:

| Returned field               | Consumed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ACCEPTANCE`                 | **Here, first.** A `not-met` line is work still owed. Sending it back costs one patch round; letting it through merges a PR that closed an issue it did not answer. Green CI does not cover this — it proves the repository still works, not that the issue was answered. |
| `UNRESOLVED`                 | **Here.** Judgment calls the agent made alone: each is accepted (and stated at step 10) or sent back, never silently inherited.                                                                                                                                           |
| `PR-SUMMARY` / `TEST-PLAN`   | [Step 4](../SKILL.md#4-open-the-pr), verbatim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `MEASURE`                    | [Triage](#triaging-the-reviews-findings) — what the PR review's findings are checked against.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `SCOPE-NOTES` / `FOLLOW-UPS` | [Step 8](../SKILL.md#8-close-out-the-findings-the-run-turned-up).                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

At most **2 patch rounds** on top of the first run, on the same tier — continuing the
same agent where the host allows, a fresh one only on a tier change. A third miss is
`NEEDS-CLARIFICATION`, not another round. A run that returned without a report, stopped
before pushing, or missed or widened the spec: [recovery.md](recovery.md) — never
re-spawn an agent that returned without its report.

## Triaging the review's findings

`review_watch.py` ([step 5](../SKILL.md#5-wait-for-the-pr-review)) numbers the PR
review's findings `F1`, `F2`, … oldest first, one line each with its priority badge and
`path:line`, and writes their bodies to the file its `findings_file:` line names. Read
every body there — never in the PR conversation, which pulls the whole thread into this
context — and only then decide anything. The review read the diff in a context that did
not write it; this session wrote or judged the diff, so it is the one that triages.

Classify **every** finding, each with a one-line reason:

- **accepted** — real, and it belongs in this diff: the same behavior change the issue
  is about, tests included. A sibling case of the bug just fixed belongs here; a schema
  change or a new public surface does not, however small the patch looks
  ([filing-followups.md](filing-followups.md)).
- **rejected** — wrong on reading the code: the case is already handled, or the fix
  would change behavior the issue did not ask to change. The reason has to hold against
  the code, not against the badge — a `P1` is not accepted for its color, and a `P3` is
  not rejected for it either.
- **out of scope** — real but not this diff's:
  [step 8](../SKILL.md#8-close-out-the-findings-the-run-turned-up).

A finding that needs an owner's decision, or a correctness finding this session cannot
settle either way, holds the PR: record `--event blocked --field reason=review-finding`
and put it in the step 10 report. Green CI cannot dismiss it. Never reply to or resolve
a review thread, and never ask the reviewer to look again (`@codex review`): neither is
in the sign-off, and a push does not start a second review.

## Fixing the accepted findings

Apply them **in the branch's own `<workdir>`** — never the main checkout in parallel
mode, which sits on the default branch: inline, or by handing
[agent-review-fix.md](agent-review-fix.md) to **`executor`** with the accepted findings
as its list. A review with zero accepted findings gets no fix run. **Keep the
`review_watch.py` numbers** — the fix brief returns `APPLIED`/`REJECTED` against those
same `F<n>`, and without them the returned lines cannot be matched back to what was
sent.

When anything other than this session wrote the fixes, **reading what the fix pass
changed is the safeguard**: `git -C <workdir> diff <pre-fix-head>..HEAD`, not the whole
branch. Revert what it got wrong. Read every `REJECTED` line — a rejection that reads like
a real defect goes back with the reason addressed; real-but-out-of-scope goes to step 8.
Run the verification command **in `<workdir>`**, then push. The push is a new head: the
earlier CI verdict says nothing about it, so step 6 watches again, and no second review
is waited for — the corrections are covered by local verification and current-head CI.

Record, per PR, once the triage is done:
`--event review --field issue=<n> --field pr=<pr> --field verdict=<CLEAN|FINDINGS|NO_REVIEW|ERROR> --field reviewed=<sha> --field findings=<n> --field accepted=<n> --field rejected=<n> --field out-of-scope=<n> --field fixed-in=<sha>`
— `fixed-in` names the commit that addresses the accepted findings, so the report can say
which commit answered which review.
