# Run record

The persistent log every step appends to, read when setting up `<runstate>` or auditing
what a stopped run already landed.

```bash
python3 .agents/skills/shipping-issues/scripts/run_record.py --repo <owner>/<repo> --event <kind> \
    [--field k=v ...] [--body-file <path>]
```

Appends one line (or, for `run-start`, a heading plus a line) to `<runstate>/run.md`,
where **`<runstate>`** is
`${AGENT_SKILL_STATE_DIR:-$HOME/.local/state/agent-skills}/shipping-issues/<owner>__<repo>/`
— never rewritten or deleted, so a stopped run keeps what already landed. A leading `~`
in `AGENT_SKILL_STATE_DIR` is expanded by every script. `preflight.sh` and
`issue_digest.py` read `<owner>/<repo>` from the origin URL identically — git's
scp-style `[user@]host:[/]owner/repo` (a bare ssh host alias too) or
`https`, `http`, `ssh`, `git`, `git+ssh`, `ssh+git` as
`scheme://[user@]host[:port]/owner/repo`, `.git` and a trailing `/` optional; anything
else, `file://` included, is `UNKNOWN` — and `scripts/tests/test_runstate_parity.py`
holds them equal. `run_record.py` instead takes `--repo` or asks `gh repo view`
(as do `file_followup.py` and `link_check.sh`); aligning those is left to #126.

Every other file this run generates lives there too, and **never inside a repo
checkout** — the main one or a worktree: issue bodies for follow-ups, verify baselines
at `<runstate>/verify/<n>-baseline.log`, CI logs at `<runstate>/ci/<pr>.log`, in
parallel mode the worktrees themselves at `<runstate>/worktrees/<n>/`, and whatever was
moved out of the way instead of deleted at `<runstate>/holding/<n>/`, with
approval-gated commands put off until the end in `<runstate>/deferred.md`
([closing-out.md#approval-gated-commands](closing-out.md#approval-gated-commands)). An
untracked file left in a checkout makes that working tree read as dirty, and a commit
convention that stages everything would land it in the PR. Call it right after the event
happens, not batched at the end; `--repo` can be omitted when cwd is the repo being
shipped.

Events: `run-start`, `selection` (the rubric-shaped block from priority-rubric.md via
`--body-file`), `labels`, `design`, `parallel-group`, `pr-created`, `review`, `ci`,
`merged`, `followup`, `cleanup`, `blocked`, `note`.

`design` records a settled — or deliberately deferred — design, from either path:
`--field issue=<n> --field step=<2b|8b> --field mode=<inline|background> --field verdict=<DECIDED|DEFERRED>`.
`step` tells the two inline paths apart: `2b` decided the design gating the issue being
implemented, `8b` decided one from the sweep on a host without background completion. A
`DEFERRED` line is the more valuable of the two to read back: it is a question waiting
on a human, and the label still says blocked.

`parallel-group` records the plan's grouping decision once per batch (plan.py --record
writes it) —
`--field issues=<n,m,...> --field mode=<parallel|serial> --field reason=<why>`. A serial
fallback is recorded the same way as a parallel batch: the reason a run did _not_
parallelize is the part worth being able to read back.
