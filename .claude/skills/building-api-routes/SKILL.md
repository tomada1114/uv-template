  Covers the FastAPI entry point in src/my_app/api/: the create_app factory and
  app.state.container, service dependencies in dependencies.py, one APIRouter per
  resource under routers/, Pydantic request and response models in schemas.py, success
  status codes and the responses= declaration, and TestClient tests through the client
  fixture. Use when adding or changing an HTTP route, a request or response body, a
  dependency, or a router, or when removing the API. Which status a domain error
  becomes is designing-errors'. The skill is deleted along with src/my_app/api/.

# Building API Routes

**Owns:** everything under `src/my_app/api/` and `tests/api/` — the factory, the
dependencies, the routers, the wire-format models, and how a route is tested.
**Does not own:** which status a domain error becomes (`designing-errors`); the service
a route calls (`designing-core-logic`); trying a route against a live server
(`running-the-app`); module-level Python style (`writing-python`).

## A project without the API

This skill describes the HTTP entry point only. Dropping the API is a deletion, never a
core change:

- delete `src/my_app/api/`, `src/my_app/cli/serve.py` and its `app.command()(serve)`
  line in `src/my_app/cli/main.py`, `tests/api/`, and `tests/cli/test_serve.py`;
- remove the `fastapi` and `uvicorn` runtime dependencies and the `httpx` dev
  dependency, then run `uv lock`;
- remove the `just dev` recipe and the lines that name it (README's Development block,
  AGENTS.md's Quick Reference and the paragraph under it; `just check-harness` fails
  while one remains), and in `pyproject.toml`'s ruff config the `fastapi.*` entries and
  the `src/my_app/api/**` per-file-ignore;
- delete `.agents/skills/building-api-routes/`, remove its row from AGENTS.md's Skills
  table, and run `just agents-sync`.

Then prune what sibling skills say about the API:

- `designing-errors`: "The HTTP mapping", step 4 of "Adding a failure mode", and the
  API half of "Two kinds of failure" and "Configuration errors";
- `designing-core-logic`: the `building-api-routes` pointer in "Adding a use case" and
  the FastAPI thread-pool reason under "Services are the use cases";
- `running-the-app`: "Running a server of your own" and the server tier of "Evidence,
  cheapest first";
- `designing-clis`: "`serve` and imports";
- `writing-python`: the examples that quote `api/` files;
- `writing-tests`, `placing-tests`, `tdd`, and `updating-docs`: their mentions of the
  `client` fixture, `tests/api/`, a route, or an HTTP status.

## How a request flows

A route function receives its typed parameters and a service from a dependency, calls
one service method, and maps the domain result to a response model. A domain error
propagates out of the route untouched; the one `AppError` handler `create_app`
registers answers it. A route holds no rule, no `try`/`except` for an `AppError`, and
no `HTTPException` for a domain failure.

## The factory

`create_app(settings=None, *, container=None)` in `api/app.py` builds a new application
per call; there is no module-level `app`. It builds a container from `settings` (read
from the environment when omitted), or takes one a test built, and stores it on
`app.state.container`. Building remains in the factory, so configuration errors fail
at startup. Its lifespan closes only the container it built; a supplied `container=`
stays caller-owned. Use `TestClient` as a context manager to run lifespan shutdown.
It includes each router and registers the `AppError` handler.

- A new router is a module under `api/routers/`, added to the
  `from my_app.api.routers import ...` line and included with `app.include_router`.
- The API never constructs an adapter or a service: they come only from
  `composition.build_container` (`designing-core-logic`).
- `just dev` serves it through `uvicorn my_app.api.app:create_app --factory`, and
  `my-app serve` through `cli/serve.py`.

## Dependencies hand routes their services

`api/dependencies.py` has one function per service that reads the container from the
request's application, plus an `Annotated` alias a route parameter uses as its type.
Reading from `request.app.state` rather than a module global lets every `create_app`
call — one per test — own an independent store. A new service on `Container` gets its
own function and alias in the same shape:

Excerpts in this skill drop docstrings where marked; the real code keeps them, because
ruff's `D` rules require them.

```python
def get_todo_service(request: Request) -> TodoService:
    # ... docstring elided
    container: Container = request.app.state.container
    return container.todos


TodoServiceDep = Annotated[TodoService, Depends(get_todo_service)]
```

FastAPI reads a dependency function's annotations at run time too, and no
`runtime-evaluated-decorators` entry can cover it, because nothing decorates it. Every
type in its signature stays a real import, never under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`. Moved
there, `request: Request` silently becomes a required query parameter and every call
answers 422 (observed with fastapi 0.139.2, 2026-10-06). Ruff leaves `Request` alone in
`dependencies.py` only because `Depends` is a run-time import from the same package,
which the `TC` rules' default non-strict mode accepts. A dependency module without such
an import gets a `TC002` finding there, and that finding is the one to argue in a
reasoned `noqa`, not to apply. A type used only inside the body, like `Container`
above, may stay under `if TYPE_CHECKING:`.

## Routers

One module per resource, each with a single module-level `router = APIRouter(...)` with
`tags=`, plus a `prefix=` when every path in it shares one: `routers/todos.py` has
`prefix="/todos"`, while `routers/health.py` serves `/healthz` with no prefix.

- **Parameters are typed.** A path parameter typed `int` gives FastAPI's own 422 for a
  non-integer; the body is a request model; the service is the `...Dep` alias.
- **The return annotation is the response model.** Return a response model built from
  the domain result, or `None` for a 204.
- **Status codes are `HTTPStatus` members:** `status_code=HTTPStatus.CREATED` on a
  create, `HTTPStatus.NO_CONTENT` on a delete, the default 200 otherwise.
- **`responses=` lists every domain-error status the route can return,** with
  `ErrorResponse` as its model, so the OpenAPI document shows it. The dictionaries are
  module constants shared by the routes that need them (`_NOT_FOUND`,
  `_INVALID_TITLE`), with the `# Any:` comment their type needs.
- **The docstring is one plain-text line** (`writing-python` owns the rule and its
  reason).
- **`/healthz` touches no repository,** so a slow or missing database never gets a live
  process restarted. Keep a new probe the same way.

```python
@router.post("/{todo_id}/complete", responses=_NOT_FOUND)
def complete_todo(todo_id: int, service: TodoServiceDep) -> TodoResponse:
    """Mark a to-do as completed."""
    return TodoResponse.from_domain(service.complete(todo_id))
```

FastAPI reads a route's annotations at run time, so the types they name stay real
imports. `pyproject.toml`'s `runtime-evaluated-decorators` lists the `APIRouter` and
`FastAPI` decorators in use; a route registered through a decorator not on that list
needs it added there (`writing-python`).

## Schemas are the wire format

`api/schemas.py` holds every request and response body as a Pydantic `BaseModel`,
apart from the domain models, so a domain field can be renamed without breaking a
client.

- A response model maps a domain value in one classmethod, `from_domain`, the only
  place the two shapes meet — `TodoResponse.from_domain` renames `is_completed` to
  `completed`.
- A request model does not repeat a rule the core owns. `TodoCreateRequest.title` is a
  plain `str`, so the core's `InvalidTodoError` produces the one message both entry
  points share; a `Field(max_length=...)` there would answer the same mistake with
  FastAPI's differently shaped 422. Types a parser enforces (`int`, `datetime`) stay.
- Every domain error's body is `ErrorResponse`; its status is `designing-errors`'.

## Adding a route

Take reading one item by id, `GET /<resource>/{id}`, as the worked case:

1. The service needs a method for it. `TodoService` has none for a single item yet,
   though the `TodoRepository` port already has `get`; add the method and its tests
   first. **REQUIRED:** `designing-core-logic`.
2. Add the route to the resource's router module: an `int` path parameter, the service
   dependency, the response model as the return type, `responses=_NOT_FOUND`, and a
   one-line docstring.
3. The status for a missing item needs nothing new: the not-found error already maps to
   404 in `_status_for`. A new error type needs its mapping first. **REQUIRED:**
   `designing-errors`.
4. Test it (below): 200 with the body a create returned, 404 with the exact `detail`, a
   non-integer id in the parametrized 422 test, and its 404 in the OpenAPI test.
5. Add the route to the README's CLI/HTTP table.

## Testing a route

- Use the `client` fixture from `tests/api/conftest.py`:
  `TestClient(create_app(container=make_container()))`, an empty in-memory store and
  the fixed clock, so `created_at` is known exactly. Tests go in
  `tests/api/test_<router>.py`.
- Create state through the API — `tests/api/test_todos.py`'s `make_todo` factory
  fixture posts and returns the body — rather than reaching into the container.
- Assert the status against an `HTTPStatus` member and the whole JSON body; an error
  asserts `{"detail": "..."}` exactly.
- `test_openapi_documents_domain_errors_with_error_response` checks that each
  documented error points at `ErrorResponse`; add a `pytest.param` per new route.
- A behavior of the factory itself (the 400 fallback, reading the environment) is
  tested in `tests/api/test_app.py`, on its own `create_app` call.
- Run `uv run --locked pytest tests/api/`; a live server is the last resort, not the
  test (`running-the-app`).
