  Covers changing a file that enforces rather than implements: .pre-commit-config.yaml,
  scripts/check_staged.py, a .github/workflows/*.yml job, .github/rulesets/main.json,
  the justfile's verify, lint, and test recipes, typos.toml, and pyproject.toml's ruff,
  mypy, pytest, and coverage tables - and what weakening a gate means here (a removed
  ruff rule, a noqa without a reason, a lower coverage floor, a skipped test, a dropped
  CI step). Use when changing hook configuration, a lint, type, or coverage setting, or
  a CI job or required check. A hook refusing a commit is smart-commit's.

# Changing Gates

**Owns:** a change to a file that enforces rather than implements, keeping the gate
layers in step, and the list of what counts as weakening one. **Does not own:** whether
a gate may be weakened at all — never, without a human (AGENTS.md's "Security and human
approval"); a coverage floor's meaning and where a test goes (`placing-tests`); a new
tool the config would configure (`managing-dependencies`); the ruff relaxations for
scripts bundled in a skill (`authoring-skills`); writing a script a gate runs
(`writing-repo-scripts`); `.github/labels.yml` (`triaging-issues`).

A gate defines what "done" means for every later change, so a loosened rule silently
lowers the bar for every pull request after it, not only the one that touched it.

## What weakening a gate means here

Each of these is a weakening. An agent never makes one to get a run green; it stops,
says which gate looks wrong and why, and a human decides.

- **Coverage:** lowering `--cov-fail-under=80` (justfile `test`) or
  `--fail-under=80` (CI's `Coverage` job); adding a pattern to
  `[tool.coverage.report] exclude_lines`, an `omit`, or a `# pragma: no cover`.
- **Ruff:** removing a prefix from `select`; adding a code to `ignore`; adding or
  widening a `per-file-ignores` entry without a reason comment; a `# noqa` without a
  written reason after it.
- **mypy:** turning off `strict` or any `warn_*` or `enable_error_code` entry; a new
  `[[tool.mypy.overrides]]` block; a `# type: ignore` without an error code and a
  reason; a cast that only silences an error.
- **pytest:** removing `--strict-markers` or `--strict-config`; removing
  `filterwarnings = ["error"]`, or adding an `ignore` entry to it (or a
  `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings` ignore) without a reason comment and a follow-up issue,
  or one broader than the single warning it names; `@pytest.mark.skip`,
  `xfail`, a deleted test, or a weakened assertion.
- **The lock:** removing `--locked` from a recipe or a CI step, or `lock-check` from
  `just verify`.
- **The supply-chain window:** shortening `[tool.uv] exclude-newer` in `pyproject.toml`
  or a Dependabot `cooldown` in `.github/dependabot.yml` (the `uv` entry's must equal
  `exclude-newer`), or a blanket or stale `exclude-newer-package` entry
  (`managing-dependencies`).
- **The pre-commit layer:** removing a hook, narrowing its `files`, `types`, or
  `stages`, loosening `scripts/check_staged.py`'s rules, adding an entry to
  `.check-staged-allow`, `--no-verify`, `SKIP=<id>`, or an edit to `.git/hooks/`.
- **CI and the ruleset:** removing a job or a step; gating a required job with `if:`,
  `paths`, or `paths-ignore`; dropping a context from `.github/rulesets/main.json`;
  adding a bypass actor; widening a workflow's `permissions`; unpinning an action from
  its commit SHA; `persist-credentials: true`.
- **Spelling:** adding a real misspelling to `typos.toml`'s `extend-words`, or a path to
  its `extend-exclude` to hide one.

A change that tightens a gate is welcome, but still owes the pull request body three
things: which rule or option moved, why, and what now fails that did not before.

## The layers and what each sees

AGENTS.md's "Enforcement layers" names the layers. Keeping them in step is this skill's:

| Check | pre-commit | `just verify` | CI |
|---|---|---|---|
| ruff check, ruff format | `ruff`, `ruff-format` | `lint` | `Lint & Type Check` |
| mypy `src scripts tests` | `mypy` | `lint` | `Lint & Type Check` |
| Skills mirror | `agents-check` (working tree) | `agents-check` (working tree) | `Lint & Type Check` (the commit) |
| Skill script tests | — | `test-skills` | `Lint & Type Check` |
| `uv lock --check` | — | `lock-check` | `--locked` on every `uv sync` |
| Tests and the 80% floor | — | `test` | `Test` shards, then `Coverage` |
| Harness drift (`tests/harness`) and the Product section | — | `check-harness` | `Test` shards, then `Coverage` |
| typos | `typos` | — | `Spell Check` |
| zizmor | `zizmor` | — | `Workflow Security Lint` |
| Staged secrets | `check-staged` | — | the weekly gitleaks history scan |

- A check added to `just verify` gets the matching CI step, and the reverse. Nothing
  tests that the two lists agree; the reviewer reads both.
- Ruff's local system hooks run `uv run --locked ruff`, sharing `uv.lock` with
  `lint` and CI. A Ruff update moves the existing dependency range and lock; there
  is no separate hook revision to align. **BACKGROUND:** `merging-dependency-prs`.
- CI's `Spell Check` runs the pinned typos pre-commit hook with `--all-files`,
  sharing its revision, config, and file selection with local checks. Dependabot's
  `pre-commit` entry updates remote hook revisions; local hooks use the project lock.
  Dependabot supports remote pre-commit hooks
  (https://github.blog/changelog/2026-03-10-dependabot-now-supports-pre-commit-hooks/,
  checked 2026-10-07).
- CI runs zizmor through the pinned pre-commit hook with `--all-files`, sharing
  its version and file selection with local checks, including Dependabot and composite
  action definitions. Update the hook revision rather than introducing a separate CI pin.
- `just verify` runs neither typos nor zizmor; the pre-commit hook does, so prose and
  workflow changes are checked at commit time and in CI. AGENTS.md's "Validating a
  change" gives the command for each.

## CI workflows and required checks

- Every job — and every step of a composite action under `.github/actions/` — pins
  each action to a 40-character commit SHA with a `# vX.Y.Z` comment and checks out
  with `persist-credentials: false`; every job sets `timeout-minutes`. The
  top-level `permissions` is `{}` or exactly `contents: read`; a scope beyond that,
  a write above all, is granted on the job that needs it. On a workflow that also runs
  on push, concurrency never cancels a push run on `main`, pending ones included.
  Enforced by: `tests/harness/test_workflow_hygiene.py` (`just check-harness`); zizmor
  (pre-commit and CI) reports most other departures — verify with
  `uv run --locked pre-commit run zizmor --all-files`.
- A required check must be a job that runs on every pull request and cannot be skipped:
  never a job in a workflow whose `pull_request` trigger has `paths` or `paths-ignore`,
  and never a job whose `if:` could skip it — a skipped required check counts as
  passing. A job with `needs:` is guarded with `!cancelled()` or `always()` and fails on
  its own when a needed job did not succeed, as `Coverage` does; it is required instead
  of the test shards. Only a few step shapes count, read as text: Coverage's
  `if [ "$R" != "success" ]; then … exit 1; fi` as the step's first command,
  `[ "$R" = success ] || exit 1`, or a step `if: needs.X.result != 'success'` whose
  `run:` is `exit 1` (the full list is `tests/harness/_needs.py`'s docstring).
  `skipped` is not `success`, so a required job cannot need a job that is skipped on
  purpose. Enforced by: `tests/harness/test_ruleset_contexts.py`, which also fails on a
  workflow layout its scanner cannot read.
- Renaming a required job, or adding one that should block merges, edits
  `.github/rulesets/main.json` and the context list in
  `tests/test_apply_ruleset.py::test_required_contexts_match_settled_defaults` in the
  same pull request. The live ruleset changes only when the owner reruns `just ruleset`
  — an admin step an agent proposes and never runs. **BACKGROUND:** `starting-an-app`
  for the ruleset and security settings a new repository enables.
- A new workflow file is warranted only for a different trigger or permission
  footprint, never as a convenience split from `ci.yml`.

## The pre-commit layer

The hooks run for every author, so a hook that fires on intended work teaches its
author to reach for `--no-verify`, which switches off the secret gate with it. Test a
new or changed hook against an ordinary commit before trusting it to catch a bad one.
Every hook names `stages: [pre-commit]` itself; only `check-staged` also runs at
`pre-merge-commit`, and `tests/test_check_staged.py` holds that. What `check-staged`
refuses, how merges and rebases interact with it, how `just install` verifies the
hooks, and what replaced the old agent hooks:
[references/pre-commit-layer.md](references/pre-commit-layer.md).

## Tool configs in `pyproject.toml`

Read the current values in the file rather than a copy here. Traps that have cost time:

- Ruff's `per-file-target-version` pins skill scripts to `py312` and
  `scripts/check_staged.py` to `py310`, because each runs under an interpreter older
  than the project's 3.14. Never let a newer syntax rule reach them.
- `[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-tidy-imports.banned-api]` is a layer boundary, not a style
  rule. **BACKGROUND:** `designing-core-logic`.
- `[tool.ruff.lint.flake8-type-checking]`'s runtime-evaluated lists keep framework
  annotations real imports. **BACKGROUND:** `writing-python`.
- The coverage floor is not in `pyproject.toml`: it is the `80` in the justfile's `test`
  recipe and in CI's `Coverage` job. Change both or neither.

## What no gate sees

- Anything only a running server shows (`running-the-app`).
- Whether a path named in Markdown still exists. A skill's frontmatter, AGENTS.md's
  Skills table, and a `just <recipe>` in command position are `just check-harness`'s,
  but the recipe scan leaves out CHANGELOG.md, the ADRs, the roadmap, `docs/product/`
  (intent or history, not instructions), and `.devcontainer/` (JSON with comments).
- A staged deletion: `check-staged` never inspects one, by design.
- Commits that run no hook at all ([references/pre-commit-layer.md](references/pre-commit-layer.md)
  › "When the hooks run, and when they do not").

A gate proposed to close one of these gaps is a real gate, argued for in its own pull
request.
