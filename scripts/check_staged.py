"""Refuse a commit that would put a secret into history, judged from the index.

This is the secret gate of the pre-commit layer (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`,
hook id `check-staged`). It runs on `git commit` itself, so it holds for every
author -- a human, Claude Code, Codex CLI, or any other tool -- rather than only
for the agent whose hook configuration happened to be loaded.

The scope is deliberately narrow: a secret-shaped path (`.env`, `secrets/**`,
a key file, a personal agent settings file) or credential-shaped content in a
staged file. Anything else a commit might do is a judgement call that belongs
in the pull request. A hook that refuses legitimate work teaches its author to
reach for `--no-verify`, which switches this check off along with the rest.

Each staged path is judged in two phases: the path first, then -- only when the
path passes -- the staged blob. Staged blobs are read by id from the index
through one `git cat-file --batch` process; the allowlist, when present, through
one more, before it. A partially staged file is judged exactly as it will be
committed, and a refused path's content is never read. Output names the path
and the rule, never the matched text.

Exemptions live in one place: `.check-staged-allow` at the repository root,
read from the index the commit is made from (never the working tree), so the
exemption that applies is the one this commit contains. Each entry sits below a
`# reason` comment and is exact. `path <file>` lets one file past the path
rules; its content is still scanned. `content <file> <blob id>` lets that one
staged content of that file past the content patterns; any edit changes the
blob id, and the content is judged again. Globs, directories, and `.` are
refused, and an entry the index no longer matches -- a file gone or renamed,
content edited, a path no rule refuses, content no pattern matches -- fails the
commit until it is removed. A malformed or too broad allowlist judges nothing.

Deletions are not inspected: removing a file cannot add a secret, and refusing
it would block the very commit that removes one. Git runs with the inherited
environment on purpose: `git commit -a` and `git commit -- <path>` hand the hook
a temporary index through `GIT_INDEX_FILE`, and that index is what is committed.

During a merge, a staged entry whose blob (and mode) is identical to the one at
the same path in a commit being merged in is not judged again: that content was
judged when it entered the other side's history. Re-judging it would refuse
every later merge of that branch once anything matching had landed on it, and
the only way out would be to drop the other side's file. Conflict resolutions
and any other content new to both sides are still judged.

The script is stdlib-only and runs on Python 3.10+, the oldest interpreter
pre-commit itself supports, because pre-commit runs it (`language: python`)
with its own interpreter rather than the project's environment.

Usage:
    python scripts/check_staged.py

Exit codes:
    0  nothing staged is refused (including when nothing is staged)
    1  a staged path or staged content was refused
    2  git could not list or read the staged changes
    3  .check-staged-allow is malformed, too broad, or stale
