"""Mirror `.agents/skills/` into `.claude/skills/`, byte for byte.

Skills are authored once, under `.agents/skills/` -- the path Codex CLI
discovers project skills from. Claude Code only reads `.claude/skills/`, so the
same tree has to exist there too. A symlink would satisfy both lookups on one
machine but not from a fresh clone on every platform, and Codex follows a
linked directory into its subdirectories, registering a nested
`references/SKILL.md` as a skill of its own. So the second copy is a real,
committed one: generated here (`just agents-sync`) and checked by
`just agents-check`, `tests/test_sync_agents.py`, and the pre-commit hook.

Usage:
    uv run --locked python scripts/sync_agents.py          # rewrite the mirror
    uv run --locked python scripts/sync_agents.py --check  # exit 1 on drift
