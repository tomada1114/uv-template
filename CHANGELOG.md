# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial project structure
- `scripts/bootstrap.py` deterministic template initializer: renames the
  package and replaces every placeholder (`my-package`, `my_package`,
  `your-username`, `Your Name`, `you@example.com`) across tracked files
- Python 3.14 support in the CI test matrix and trove classifiers
- `zizmor` security lint for GitHub Actions workflows, wired into both CI
  and pre-commit
- `actions/dependency-review-action` on pull requests
- Weekly `pip-audit` dependency vulnerability scan
- Weekly OpenSSF Scorecard analysis
- PR auto-labeling by Conventional Commit type, so the release changelog
  categories actually populate
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` for a ready-to-use dev environment
- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml` disabling blank issues and linking
  security reports to GitHub Security Advisories
- Dependabot cooldown and `tool.uv.exclude-newer` supply-chain cutoff,
  documented in `.claude/rules/pyproject.md`

### Changed

- Moved coverage enforcement (`--cov-fail-under=80`) out of pytest
  `addopts` and into `just test` / CI, so a single test can be run in
  isolation without failing the coverage gate
- Restructured the release pipeline: a dedicated `build` job now builds
  and attests provenance once; `publish` and the GitHub Release both
  consume that artifact instead of rebuilding
- Scoped all workflow permissions to job level, added `timeout-minutes`
  to every job, added `--locked` to every `uv sync` in CI, and disabled
  checkout credential persistence outside the docs deploy job
- Simplified `src/my_package/__init__.py`'s version resolution to the
  standard `importlib.metadata.version()` pattern, dropping the ~50-line
  local-pyproject-walking fallback chain
- Replaced the bespoke `no-commit-to-main` pre-commit hook with the
  pre-commit-hooks builtin `no-commit-to-branch`
- Unified mypy targets (`src scripts tests`) across justfile, CI,
  release, and pre-commit
- Expanded ruff rule set (`D`, `PT`, `N`, `TRY`, `EM`, `DTZ`, `RSE`,
  `PGH`) to match `.claude/rules/python.md`; renamed `TCH` -> `TC`

### Fixed

- Switched to PEP 639 license metadata (`license-files`, dropped the
  redundant OSI trove classifier)
